🧑‍🎓 Students Management Exercise
🧠 Problem Description
Write a C++ program to manage students’ information using structs and vectors.

Each student has:

A name

A grade (from 0 to 100)

✅ Program Requirements
Your program should:

Ask the user to enter data for a fixed number of students (e.g. 5 students):

Student name

Student grade (must be between 0 and 100)

Convert all student names to uppercase letters.

Store all students in a vector of struct Student.

Display the list of students with their grades.

Calculate and display the average grade of all students.

Ask the user to enter a student name and:

Display the student’s grade if found

Display "Student not found" if the name does not exist

💡 Concepts Practiced
struct

vector

Loops

Input validation

String manipulation

Linear search

Basic algorithmic thinking

⏱️ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

📝 Notes
This exercise helps practice:

Organizing data using structs

Working with collections (vector)

Writing clean and readable C++ code

Applying basic algorithms (average, search)





Bonus: Find the student with the highest and lowest grade.
